# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Chang'an University, conducting research on situational awareness in nearshore environments. My work focuses on multimodal fusion, multi-object tracking, and vision-language large models. Currently, I am deeply involved in AI Agent projects for specific scenarios as part of my doctoral research. In addition, I have conducted research on traditional computer vision (CV), edge computing, and C++ front-end development (QT) and have independently developed a complete set of front-end and back-end algorithms for industrial production (Digital Radiography imaging), which generated millions in value. If you're interested in my work, feel free to email me.

[Novel Pipeline Integrating Cross-Modality and Motion Model for Nearshore Multi-Object Tracking in Optical Video Surveillance](https://doi: 10.1109/TITS.2024.3373370) <br> **Jiangang Ding**, Wei Li, Lili Pei, Ming Yang, Aojia Tian, Bo Yuan <br> [**Project**](https://github.com/Ding-JianGang/Cross-Modality-MOT-in-Nearshore-Environments) <strong> | SCI Journal Paper</strong>
- We propose a holistic cross-modality NMOT pipeline based on optical video surveillance and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in multiple benchmark evaluations.
- We developed a simple yet effective CBT to decouple and guide the fusion of the RGB and thermal infrared video streams. Additionally, we introduce a Temporal Context Transformer to mitigate the various complex degradations caused by video signals by integrating feature information from the current and historical frames.
- We heuristically model the motion interrelationships of objects to compensate for the Kalman Filter prior estimates, synchronously combining low-confidence modeling and MCM to assist with association and tracklet correction.
