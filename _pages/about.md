# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Chang'an University, conducting research on situational awareness in nearshore environments. My work focuses on multimodal fusion, multi-object tracking, and vision-language large models. Currently, I am deeply involved in AI Agent projects for specific scenarios as part of my doctoral research. In addition, I have conducted research on traditional computer vision (CV), edge computing, and C++ front-end development (QT) and have independently developed a complete set of front-end and back-end algorithms for industrial production (Digital Radiography imaging), which generated millions in value. If you're interested in my work, feel free to email me.
