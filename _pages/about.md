# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at Chang'an University, conducting research on situational awareness in nearshore environments. My work focuses on multimodal fusion, multi-object tracking, and vision-language large models. Currently, I am deeply involved in AI Agent projects for specific scenarios as part of my doctoral research. If you're interested in my work, feel free to email me.
